CDC does not collect or store any personal information
when you use Positive Health Check on any device. The study ID and password provided to PHC
users by clinics participating in the PHC Randomized Control Trial, along with the
intervention data, are not connected with patient names at CDC. Participating clinics
maintain their own separate, secure records that allow them to connect study IDs to
patients within their clinics.

<b>Using CDC's Mobile Applications</b>
<br />
When you use CDC’s Mobile Applications (Apps), certain information will be gathered and stored
about your usage of the App. This information does not identify you personally. We collect and
store information as follows:
<ul>
    <li>
        CDC receives aggregate data about the use of our Apps, such as the number of times the
        applications have been opened or the interactions or actions completed in the application.
        This is gathered via a third party provider
        <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/other/third-party-pages.html">(please refer to the tools
            list(http://www.cdc.gov/other/third-party-pages.html))</a>. We also receive aggregate
        data from the platforms that distribute our Apps (currently the iTunes Store, Google Play
        Store, and the Windows Store), such as the number of people who download the App and mobile
        set-up information (e.g., device model, App version, country, language, and mobile carrier).
        Please consult the privacy policies of these third parties for further information.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may sign up to receive “push notification” messages via a third party provider
        <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/other/third-party-pages.html">(please refer to the tools
            list(http://www.cdc.gov/other/third-party-pages.html))</a>. To make sure messages reach
        the correct devices, our third party provider relies on a device token unique to your
        mobile device. A device token is a unique identifier issued to the app by the operating
        system of the mobile device. While we may be able to access a list of the tokens, the App
        and tokens do not reveal your identity, unique device ID, or contact information to us. The
        third party provider may collect the following: the time of an event, how a User came to
        our site, what search engine and search keywords users may have used to get to our site,
        information about the device our user is on such as their Operating System, and browser,
        as well as the city, region and country location of users. This location information
        enables CDC to send public health push notification messages that are relevant to certain
        geographic locations. If, at any time, you wish to stop receiving push notifications,
        simply adjust your phone settings or remove the App.
    </li>
</ul>
<br />
CDC does not disclose, share, sell, or transfer any information about CDC digital media visitors
or users unless required for law enforcement or otherwise required by law.
<br /><br />
For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, CDC
employs software programs to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or
otherwise cause damage.
<br /><br />
CDC’s digital media are maintained by the U.S. Government and is protected by various provisions of
Title 18, U.S. Code. Violations of Title 18 are subject to criminal prosecution in Federal court.

<b>Children and Privacy on CDC.gov</b>

    Protection Act (COPPA)</a> governs information gathered online from or about children under
the age of 13. Verifiable consent from a child’s parent or guardian is required before collecting,
using, or disclosing personal information from a child under age 13. Our digital media is not
intended to solicit information of any kind from children under age 13. If you believe that we have
received information from or about children under age 13, please contact the CDC Senior Official
