Positive Health Check (PHC) is a product of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), a branch of the Department of Health and Human Services. PHC
was developed for people living with HIV (PLWH) to supplement their HIV primary care provider
visits. It aims to improve health outcomes of PLWH, by promoting treatment initiation,
medication adherence, retention in care, sexual risk reduction, and reducing injection drug
use behavior. The intervention also provides information about the prevention of
mother-to-child transmission.<br /><br />An interactive tool, PHC provides patients tailored
information based on their responses to questions and topic selections. It was developed
for patients that would like to receive additional information and strategies to support
their medical care and treatment, regardless of length of time since diagnosis.<br /><br />Positive
Health Check is currently only accessible to patients with a valid study ID and password as
provided by designated clinics working with CDC in the PHC Randomized Control Trial.
