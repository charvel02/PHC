    provide qualifying patients credentials to access Positive Health Check.

    <b>A:</b> Contact the clinic that issued your study ID/password to provide you your ID or reset
    password.

    intervention outside the clinic?
    <br />

    secure area with your clinic records to be given to you at your next visit.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Q:</b> Who can see the information that I provide in PHC?
    <br />
    <b>A:</b> Authorized clinic staff working on this project will be able to access information
    you provide in the intervention and link it to you. Other project staff outside of the clinic
    will be able to view information you provided in the intervention but only by your study ID
    (your name is not included).

    <b>Q:</b> What if my study ID and/or password aren’t working?
    <br />
    <b>A:</b> PHC was designed to be used by patients multiple times but no sooner than 2 months
    from their last visit to the intervention. If you receive the following messages, a description
    of the error that occurred is provided:
        <ul>
            <li>
                "Study ID and password don’t match”- the password wasn’t entered correctly.
            </li>
            <li>
                “Study ID is invalid”- the Study ID entered was incorrect.
            </li>
            <li>
                Please contact clinic staff for assistance”-
                contact clinic staff and they will advise you of when you can log in again or activate your
                session. Please contact the clinic that assigned you your ID for assistance if you are unable
                to recall the correct study ID and/or password.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <br />
    <b>Q:</b> I downloaded the app, but how can I join the study?
    <br />
    <b>A:</b> Only a small number of clinics were selected to work with Positive Health Check (PHC)
    at this time. At a later time, PHC will be assessed for broader use and access by other
    patients. Stay tuned.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Q:</b> Who do I contact if I have questions about the content presented in PHC?
    <br />
    <b>A:</b> Talk with your doctor or nurse at the clinic that issued you your study ID to address
    any questions you may have.

    <br />
    <b>A:</b> The Extra Info site is available for 7 days after you complete each intervention
    session. You can contact your clinic if you require specific information or assistance.
